        <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
        <h2>2/30/2022</h2>
        <p>
            During some of class, I set up a submodule into my own git repo I use
            to store my old CS assignments from the assignment repo and did the
            initial commit.
        </p>

        <h2>3/5/2022</h2>
        <p>
            I spent some of my time during class working on this assignment.
            I've done HTML before so I could get a head start on it. I got done
            answering the questions and plan to add an img of myself soon.
            I ended up forgetting to commit it so I'm committing it now.
        </p>

        <h2>3/6/2022</h2>
        <p>
            Made the code more readable and added an image of myself. I also started
            this code blog.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>
                What challenges or troubles did you have completing the assignment.
                How did you work through them?
            </strong> <br/>

            I didn't have any real troubles working on this assignment. I already knew
            HTML before this, so it was pretty easy, hardest part was probably picking
            a picture of myself to use. <br/><br/>

            <strong>
                What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
            </strong> <br/>

            I already knew most things for this assignment, but it was a good refresher
            on how to make HTML documents, I didn't remember the DOCTYPE and all that
            jazz. <br/><br/>

            <strong>
                What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did
                you use these resources?
