        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p><b>What is the most complex/interesting thing you've done with your
        current web development skills?</b><br>

        I made a website one time with HTML and CSS for a web class I took in
        highschool. It's available at 
        <a href="http://spraguehs.com/students/students18/hart_jack/" target="_blank">
        this</a> link, it's not super impressive, I didn't take my classes super seriously 
        in highschool, but I'm still kind of proud of it. <br><br>

        <b>What do you hope to learn from this class?</b><br>
        I hope to solidify my skills in web development in a more formal way while also
        learning what web development looks like more in the real world. <br><br>

        <b>Have you signed up for CampusWire</b><br>
        Yes. <br><br>

        <b>A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique
        experience you've had</b><br>
        Outside my CS work, I like to practice a sport called Colorguard. It is
        essentially ballet with the added bonus of spinning and tossing flags, rifles,
        sabres, and other forms of equipment. We're seen most alongside a marching band,
        but there's a winter version called Winterguard, and there we dance to whatever
        recorded music we decide on, it's a lot of fun and incredibly fun to watch at
        the professional level. If you look up "WGI performance" on Youtube, you'll get
        a lot of really cool performances.
